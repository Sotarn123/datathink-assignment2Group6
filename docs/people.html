    <h1>People</h1>    
    <p> We have divided the tasks into four steps: the dataset, the algorithm, the web page and also the text on the web page.</p> 
    <p>(A note from the "web designer" Emma: The images of cats on the people's webpage is used to illustrate that the website can display images, without us having to provide pictures of ourselves.)</p>
