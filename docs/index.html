    <h1>Project group 6</h1>
    <p> Welcome! This is the website built by group 6 for the assignment in Datalogical thinking 7,5 hp, at the university of bor√•s.  </p>
    <h2>Our algorithm</h2>
    <p>We have chosen to make an algorithm based on the dataset from the web library Litterturbanken. We wanted to investigate what the publication in Littertaurbanken has looked like, and chose to base it on data from the last 30 years. We wanted to find out to what extent male and female authors are published. 
In our selection we first started with books printed from the years between 1999 and 2025. Then we realized there were too few books for our project, and changed to 1995-2025 instead. We also limited the search to novels. The result was 58 novels printed between 1995 and 2025. A year earlier than 1995 could have provided too much data to go through. In our dataset we wanted to have the full names of the authors, their gender and also the book titles. We divided into different csv.files. For example, we wanted to find out what the distribution looks like with the published books in the database. Which authors have written which books, what years were the books printed, what is the gender distribution among the authors. This would then be processed by our algorithm through pseudocode. </p>
