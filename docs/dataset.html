    <h1>Dataset</h1>
    <p> Here we present our dataset from Litteratur banken. The actual dataset in the form of .csv files are in the GitHub repository.  </p>
    <h2>A presentation of our dataset and how we curated it.</h2>
    <p> In the data model the csv. data are divided into tables based on category. The first category is books.csv which includes author_id, title, subtitle, year. For example b1, "Drottningens juvelsmycke”, 2000 and b2, "Det går an”, 2011. The authors.csv contains author_id, name, gender. For example, au1, “Carl Jonas Love Almqvist”, M and au2, “Fredrika Bremer”, F. Then there are books_and_authors.csv with book_id and author_id, like b2, au1 or b3,au2. This dataset describes and connects the information we wanted to find out. It includes 58 books printed during the years 1995 and 2025. The tables in the database include the books, titles and years and authors, names and gender. We have chose to structure our dataset in this way so that, based on this dataset the algorithm can process it. </p>
