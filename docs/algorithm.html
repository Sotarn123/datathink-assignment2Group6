    <h1>Algorithm</h1>
    <p>Here we introduce our algorithm, and describe how it is inteded to work.</p>
    <h2>Our algorithm</h2>
    <p>The algorithm is processing the dataset with pseudocode, and is written in a txt.file. The algorithm is reading the csv.files containing book and author data. It counts the books per authors within the time period 1995-2025 that we have chosen. It also counts books per gender within this time period. Then it creates two lists one for the author results and one for the gender results. The author list contains author names and book counts. The gender list includes genders and book counts. Then it sorts the two result lists by sorting out the author 
results by the number of books descending and then author name ascending. The gender results are sorted by number of books descending. Finally the both result lists are returned. Author results as list of (author_name, number_of_books) and Gender results as list of (author_gender, number_of_books). </p>
